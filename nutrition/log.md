# Calorie & Macro Log

Plain-text mirror of the daily food log. `meals.csv` is the machine-readable
source of truth; `calorie_tracker.xlsx` is generated from it. Keep all three in
sync by editing `meals.csv` and re-running `build_tracker.py`.

## Rules

- One photo = one meal (sometimes a supplement or snack).
- Estimates are **ranges (low–high)** — photo-based estimates aren't exact.
- Trends use the **midpoint** of each range.
- Items the user removed (skipped a chutney, ate fewer pieces) are recalculated
  out, not left in.
- **Nothing is logged unless actually consumed.** "Planning to" ≠ logged.
  Unconfirmed items sit in the `pending` status and count toward no total.

## Goals

- Calorie deficit before December.
- 6-day Push/Pull/Legs split.
- Protein target ~90–130 g/day (adjust to bodyweight).
- Whey protein (black coffee or water) as the low-cal protein lever.
- UAE-based; meals mostly South Indian / Kerala style.

## Day 1 — 2026-09-04

| Meal | Items | Calories | Protein | Fat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | Dosa + sambar + red chutney (skipped coconut chutney) | 360–450 | 6–9 g | 8–12 g |
| Lunch | Chicken biryani (half plate) + raita | 500–680 | 25–35 g | 18–28 g |
| Snack | Black coffee + 1 whey scoop | 100–130 | 20–25 g | 1–3 g |
| Snack | 1 cookie (cashew/almond biscuit) | 38 | 0.5 g | 2 g |
| Dinner | 2 maida porotta + kadala curry | 520–800 | 15–21 g | 23–38 g |
| **TOTAL** | | **1,518–2,098** | **66.5–90.5 g** | **52–83 g** |
| **Midpoint** | | **1,808** | **78.5 g** | **67.5 g** |

Notes: dinner porotta was the heaviest single item (refined flour + oil). Dropped
from 3 to 2 porotta to tighten calories and fat. Protein midpoint landed just
under the 90 g floor.

## Day 2 — 2026-09-05 (in progress)

| Meal | Items | Calories | Protein | Fat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Breakfast | 2 dosa + sambar + red chutney (skipped coconut chutney) | 410–520 | 11–15 g | 10–17 g |
| Snack | Black coffee + 1 whey scoop (no sugar) | 100–130 | 20–25 g | 1–3 g |
| Lunch | Fish fry + ~half container barik rice + sambar + veg raita + red chutney + veg side | 590–840 | 28–39 g | 20–33 g |
| Snack | 1 whey scoop + water | 100–120 | 20–25 g | 1–2 g |
| **TOTAL (logged so far)** | | **1,200–1,610** | **79–104 g** | **32–55 g** |
| **Midpoint** | | **1,405** | **91.5 g** | **43.5 g** |

### Pending — not counted in any total until confirmed

| Item | Calories | Protein | Fat | Why it's pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-workout scoop | 5–15 | 0 g | 0 g | Planned but not taken as of last check. Negligible either way. |

**Resolved 2026-09-05:** the 70 g chocolate bar was **not eaten** — confirmed by
the user, who had whey with water instead. Row removed from the log entirely.

**Dinner: not yet eaten** — no row exists for it.

Where the day lands once the pending item resolves:

| Scenario | Calories | Protein | Fat |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logged only (current) | 1,200–1,610 (mid 1,405) | 79–104 g | 32–55 g |
| + pre-workout | 1,205–1,625 (mid 1,415) | 79–104 g | 32–55 g |

Read: with the bar off the table, there is real room for dinner inside a
deficit. Matching Day 1's midpoint (1,808) leaves roughly **400 kcal** for
dinner; coming in under Day 1 leaves 250–350. Fat is the loose macro at 43.5 g
midpoint against Day 1's 67.5 g, so a porotta-style dinner would eat that
headroom fast — rice or chapati with a curry costs less.

## Trends

Two days is not yet a trend — this fills in as days accumulate. Current daily
midpoints:

| Date | Calories | Protein | Fat | Complete? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-04 | 1,808 | 78.5 g | 67.5 g | yes |
| 2026-09-05 | 1,405 | 91.5 g | 43.5 g | no — dinner pending |

Protein is the one to watch: Day 1 finished below the 90 g floor, and Day 2 is
already at 91.5 g before dinner, on the back of two whey scoops.
